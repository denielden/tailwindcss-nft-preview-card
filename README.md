## My process

I have optimized the provided `.jpg` assets using the `.webp` image format.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Accessibility first
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned how to use **tailwindcss**.

For start the Tailwind CLI build process in this project run:
``` npm
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/style.css --watch
```

Tailwind is very convenient but sometimes in the elements that need many classes I find the html too long and confusing.  
What do you think about it?
